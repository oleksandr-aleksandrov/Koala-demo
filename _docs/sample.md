### 4.3.5. Editing a sample

From simple editing to extreme, **Koala** has more than one trick up its sleeve. Let's have a tour.

**1.Basic editing**
These are Koala basics editing to know by heart.

![Re-sample from app](https://lh3.google.com/u/1/d/1ECqjotnHWwTJ1fdsQmNqHD8Ifj2dUODG=w1920-h500-iv1)
Select the pad you want to edit by pressing it.
> **Note** : when you adjust the params, your sample is sometimes too short so you can't hear slight modification, try
> to play repeatedly and turn the knobs !

![Re-sample from app](https://lh3.google.com/u/1/d/1ECqjotnHWwTJ1fdsQmNqHD8Ifj2dUODG=w1920-h500-iv1)
Hold `"VOL"` and slide up or down to adjust the volume of your sample.

Drag and drop your sample to an already used pad.
Click `"Mix"` to mix the 2 sources and create a new sound.

> **Note :** All the parameters you set on your samples are kept for creating the new sound, you can explore around the
> different editing possibilities to create unique sounds !

![Re-sample from app](https://lh3.google.com/u/1/d/1ECqjotnHWwTJ1fdsQmNqHD8Ifj2dUODG=w1920-h500-iv1)

Click `"SPLIT"` and lets process.

> The result is placed on the first(s) empty pad(s) after the original one."

## 4.5. Samuraï ops #SAMURAÏ

### 4.5.1. Time stretch a sample

> Imagine if you can turn music into chewing gum? Hmmm, yeah, your Samuraï Koala think he can do it... He worked so much
> his sound martial arts he became very elastic !

**1. Understand the time-stretching**
Time-stretching is a digital audio effect whose purpose is to shorten or lengthen the duration and/or tempo of a sound
recording without changing its pitch.

**2. Find the time stretch function**

![Re-sample from app](https://lh3.google.com/u/1/d/1ECqjotnHWwTJ1fdsQmNqHD8Ifj2dUODG=w1920-h500-iv1)
Open the sample editor by clicking `"EDIT"` and navigate with the arrows until you find `"STRETCH"`

**3. Activate time stretch**

![Re-sample from app](https://lh3.google.com/u/1/d/1ECqjotnHWwTJ1fdsQmNqHD8Ifj2dUODG=w1920-h500-iv1)

Click `"Stretch"`, you can now see a new field with red background at the top of the waveform.
Once the time stretching activated, the looping points (start/end) of your sample sticks to your project BPM.

**4. Set a time stretch duration**
To let Koala calculate the time-stretch, you have to define a stretch duration sample, the basic unit is the BEAT, and a
BAR is 4 beats of course !
The time stretch duration represents how long you want your sample to play.

> Note : Remember, now your sample stick to the project bpm.

**6. Description of stretch algorithms**

- Modern - Made for complex songs with polyphonic material.
- Retro - Emulate classic granular time-stretch
- Beats - Prioritises the preservation of transients, so you get punchy sound.
- Repitch - Play the sound the way it should physically.
