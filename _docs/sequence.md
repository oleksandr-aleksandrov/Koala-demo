### 5.1. Introduction
Koala is a powerful yet easy to use sequencer. It allows you to create up to 32 patterns.
The pattern lenght is up to 64 bars, so you can litterally compose hours of music! 
The sequencer is really high resolution.

### 5.2. Overview
- { PICS } interface + Basic explanations

### 5.3. Basic ops
You want to be comfy creating your pattern? With this instructions, Koala won't have secrets for you anymore.

### 5.3.1. Survival knowledge
--help
This is the `"Need to know"` to start using Koala's sequencer.

**1. What is a pattern?**
- A pattern consists of a grid on which you can place events (triggers) that you can play in loop.

> Note: With Koala you can record patterns but you'll need the "Piano Roll" function to see the grid, this is available with the #SAMURAÏ extension.

- { PICS } / image of a pattern grid
- All pattern have a lenght (1 BAR, 2 BARS, etc...) and a number of beats/bar (2, 3, 4, 5, etc...).
- { PICS } / image of a pattern grid containing events 
- When you record a pattern, playing pads will place triggers in the grid. A soon as the pattern reach its looping point, your hear what you recorded.

**2. Record / play a pattern**
The play/record buttons possibly appears at differents places in the SEQUENCER, it's always the same way to use it.

- { PICS }
- Play/Stop a pattern
- Click `"PLAY"`
- { PICS }
- Record a pattern
- Click `"RECORD"` and press pads
- { PICS } / img `"PLAY vs REC"` + `"Stop" pictogram"`
- 2 ways stopping a recording
- Click `"PLAY"`, the playback stops.
- Click `"RECORD"`, the recording stops but the pattern still playback.
- { PICS }{ PICS } / img sequence

> Ex: if you have a pattern of 1 BAR and 4 beats/bar, play a kick sample pad on the 1st and 3rd beats, then a snare sample pad on the 2nd and the 4th beats. Gongrats, you've made your 1st Boom Bap!

**3. Undo**
- { PICS }
- Click `"UNDO"`
- When the last event (trigger) you recorded dont fit your pattern, you can cancel your lasts operations.
- It's possible to click once or several times to undo up to all events of your last recording.

**4. Pattern banks**
You have 4 banks of 8 patterns, so up to 32 patterns
- { PICS }
- Use the narrows to navigate the banks.

**5. Set a pattern lenght**
Note: the pattern lenght button possibly appears at differents places in the `SEQUENCER`, it's always the same way to use it.
- { PICS }

You've eaten a Jay Dee donuts at breakfast? Now, you feel like your beats need more groove, no panic Koala handle it!
- { PICS }
- What is quantization?
- Quantization is a time correction of what you record in the sequencer.
- Go back to our 1 BAR pattern, its default quantization in Koala Sampler is 1/16. 
With the Piano Roll, you can set several quantizations. Only available with #SAMURAÏ extension.
- That means, your BAR is divided in 16 part called steps.
- { PICS }
- Click `"BPM"` to open the bpm window
- { PICS }
- Toggle OFF `"QUANTIZE"`, now there's no quantisation anymore you record in real time!
- export

### 5.4. Keyboard mode
To trigger your samples, you can use the conventional pads or the keybord mode. There are 3 modes giving you ability to play your samples chromatically, turn any sound into a synth!

### 5.4.1. Open the mode selector.
The keybord button possibly appears at differents places in the SEQUENCER, it's always the same way to use it.
- { PICS }
- Click `"KEYBOARD"` and choose a pad, the selector pops. 

>Note: the pictogram appears with flashy blue background,

### 5.4.2. Select a mode

Play a very large scale on a grid.
- { PICS }
- Click `"GRID"`, the last selected sample is now layered chromatically on the grid.
- - Keyboard
Play on a piano keybord with velocity!
- { PICS }
- Click `"KEYBORD"`, the last selected sample is now layered chromatically on classical piano keybord.
- - Note repeat
Trigger your sample repeatedly with differents quantizations just holding it.
- { PICS }
- Click `"NOTE REPEAT"`, the note repeat `"fat pad"` opens. You can now trigger repeatedly the selected sample with the quantizations displayed on the "fat pad".

### 5.4.3. Chose the scale
> Note: By default, the scale is pentatonic in Koala Sample, but he also got a swiss knife and lets you play the scale you love. 

The keybords will display only the good notes in the selected scale.

### 5.5. Samuraï ops: Piano Roll #SAMURAÏ

### 5.5.1. Overview of the Piano Roll
- {PICS} UI presentation + description

### 5.5.2. Introduction Piano Roll
- The piano roll is basically an editor where you can write your pattern or correct it. 
- It consist of a grid representing your pads vertically (or your notes if you're in `"KEYBOARD"` mode) and the time horizontally (your bars and beats).
- The grid is generally called a step sequencer. It illustrate a 1/16 quantization, so 16 steps per BAR, but you can also place events anywhere you want.
- You can put your triggers in the grid and give them behaviors after.

### 5.5.3. Piano Roll - Step sequencer
**1. Add / delete events in the step sequencer**
- {PICS} 
- To add an event, simply click on the grid where you want your sample triggers. To help you, beats and steps divisions are displayed.
- Remember the columns represents the pads (or the notes in `"KEYBORD"` mode) and the rows represents the time (bars). 
- {PICS}
- To delete an event, just click on it.

**2. Event field**
- {PICS}
- In the EVENT field, you can choose what event you want to act on. 
- There are 3 types of event but 1st, you always need to place trigger events.

> Note: the selected pictogram appears with flashy blue background

- Event types
- Trigger - trigger a note
- Velocity - adjust velocity on a trigger
- Chance - add a triggering chance to a trigger

**3. Snap to grid (Quantization)**
Snap grid is the quantization, the value you set here affect live recording.
- {PICS} 
- Select a quantization
- Click `"SNAP"` to open a drop-down menu, then select your quantization.
- {PICS} 
- Toggle ON `"snap end"` if you want the event lenght to be the same as the quantization when you record live.

**4. Adjust the velocity**

> Note: the pictogram appears with flashy blue background when selected.

- {PICS} 
- Click "VEL" in the event field, now you can slide the events to adjust velocity.

**5. Determine a triggering chance**

> Note: the pictogram appears with flashy blue background when selected."

- {PICS} 
- Click `"CHANCE"` in the event field, now you can slide the events to adjust the triggering chance between 0% and 100%.

> Note: chance is illustrated with a dice pictogram.

> Note 2: Yeah it's a kind of weird action putting an event in the grid and give it 0% chance to trig... Maybe a proof that koala's god himself isn't perfect.

**6. Undo / Redo**

> Note: The undo works the same as in pattern page.

- { PICS }
- Click "UNDO" or "REDO" to navigate the historic of actions in your pattern.
Note: By doing that, you can listen to your pattern in different states."

**7. Zoom in / out**
- {PICS}
- Pinch with two fingers
You know that move, don't you?
