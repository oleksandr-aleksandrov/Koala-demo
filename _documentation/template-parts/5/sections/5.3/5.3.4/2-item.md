- What is quantization?
- Quantization is a time correction of what you record in the sequencer.
- Go back to our 1 BAR pattern, its default quantization in Koala Sampler is 1/16.
  With the Piano Roll, you can set several quantizations. Only available with #SAMURA√è extension.
- That means, your BAR is divided in 16 part called steps.
