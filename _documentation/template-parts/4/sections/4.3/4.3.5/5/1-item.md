**5. Trim samples**

Adjust the start and end points of your samples.

Open the sample editor by clicking `"EDIT"`, you have now a window with the waveform of your sample.

Zoom in and out the waveform with two fingers.

> **Note :** Koala Sampler is extremely precise, you'll see what's a sharp waveform !
