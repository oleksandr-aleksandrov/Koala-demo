- The piano roll is basically an editor where you can write your pattern or correct it.
- It consist of a grid representing your pads vertically (or your notes if you're in `"KEYBOARD"` mode) and the time horizontally (your bars and beats).
- The grid is generally called a step sequencer. It illustrate a 1/16 quantization, so 16 steps per BAR, but you can also place events anywhere you want.
- You can put your triggers in the grid and give them behaviors after.
