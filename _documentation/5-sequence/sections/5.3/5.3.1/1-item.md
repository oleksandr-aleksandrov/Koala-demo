**1. What is a pattern?**
- A pattern consists of a grid on which you can place events (triggers) that you can play in loop.

> Note: With Koala you can record patterns but you'll need the "Piano Roll" function to see the grid, this is available with the #SAMURA√è extension.

- { PICS } / image of a pattern grid
- All pattern have a lenght (1 BAR, 2 BARS, etc...) and a number of beats/bar (2, 3, 4, 5, etc...).
- { PICS } / image of a pattern grid containing events
- When you record a pattern, playing pads will place triggers in the grid. A soon as the pattern reach its looping point, your hear what you recorded.
