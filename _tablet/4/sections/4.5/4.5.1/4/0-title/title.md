**4. Set a time stretch duration**

To let Koala calculate the time-stretch, you have to define a stretch duration sample, the basic unit is the BEAT, and a
BAR is 4 beats of course !
The time stretch duration represents how long you want your sample to play.

> Note : Remember, now your sample stick to the project bpm.
