**6. Choke samples**

With Koala Sampler, you can put samples in choke groups so that each sample stops the playback of the previous sample
triggered in the same group. There are 6 choke groups at all.

> **ex :** put an open hi-hat and a closed one in a group and let them cutting each other !

Open the sample editor by clicking `"EDIT"` and select `"CHOKE: OFF"`
